## Project title:
Movie Recommender

### Please check the 'Projects' tab for ongoing updates to this project

## The goal of this project: 
The objective of this project is to assess a userâ€™s movie-watching history is to recommend movies based on different aspects of the data set given. Examples of what relationships can be drawn may include portraying actors in the movie, the genre, and the ratings the movie has gotten.  The recommender will be deployed using a Python package named StreamLit. If the objective was to be completed and that there is a surplus of time, then a new objective including of either sentiment analysis within the model or to create fictitious movie name based on the user's history will be included within the project's specifications. In order to achieve this, I will use cosine similarity (with this being in mind, the usage of a linear kernel may be done here in order to be more time efficient) and natural language processing (NLTK) in order to recommend movies. The concept of using sentiment analysis is to choose recommended movies that has an underlying relationship behind the user's preferences and the tags that they given to the movie. 

## About this project:
This project entails creating a content-based and collaborative-filtering recommender model based on a data set from GroupLens.  
This data set includes the specifications between the movie ID, the title, and the genres. This data collection will also include what the users think of the movies, which would include the rating and tags given to each movie. The rating and tag information would have the details of when that specific action was made. The tag information may be a single word, or a whole sentence. Each movie would have a combination of one or more genres, which are separated by a line.
